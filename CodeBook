Code book for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

The data set that this code book apply to can be found in the tidydata.txt file of this repository.
The README.md file in this repository contains the background information on this data set. The structure of this data set is defined in the Data section. The variables are listed under the Variable section and the transformation performed in the Transformation section.

Transformations
The raw data is located at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The following steps were taken in the transformation of the source data:
1.	The training and the test sets was merged to create a new data set.
2.	The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (containing the string “mean” and “std”) were extracted for each measurement.
3.	Add descriptive activity names to replace the original integer code between 1 to 6.
4.	Variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names using the following rules:
a.	Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed
b.	The initial f and t were change to frequencyDomain and timeDomian
c.	Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Frequency, mean, and StandardDeviation
d.	 Fix the typo error on the source ‘s features_info.txt file from “BodyBody” to “Body”
5.	From the data set in step 4, an independent file was created (tidydata.txt) that contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject within the data set.


The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the run_analysis.R R script (see README.md file for usage instructions).
